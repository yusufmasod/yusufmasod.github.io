### Printing Process Control
This course addresses process and quality control in offset lithography, treating prepress, plate making, and printing as an integrated workflow. Emphasis is placed on understanding color perception, color reproduction theory, plate-making procedures, and pressrun operations. Measurement, standards, and specifications are presented as necessary components for controlling print quality in offset lithography.

- Integrated workflow: prepress, plate making, and printing  
- Fundamentals of color perception  
- Color reproduction theory in offset lithography  
- Plate-making procedures  
- Pressrun operation  
- Measurement in print quality control  
- Standards and specifications for process control  

**Learning activities and tools**
- Monitor color verification using X-Rite i1Profiler  
- Color measurement using X-Rite i1 Pro  
- Analysis of verification reports (ΔE₀₀ values, neutral gray range)  
- Dot uniformity testing on offset printing plates  
- Use of Techkon Spectroplate and SpectroConnect software  
- Digital color proof verification using Fogra MediaWedge CMYK V3  
- Process control analysis based on Solid Ink Density (SID)  
- Tone Value Increase (TVI / Dot Gain) analysis  
- Print Contrast measurement
