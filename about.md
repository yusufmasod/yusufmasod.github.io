# About

I am an academic staff member at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) working in the areas of printing technology, print production systems, and related manufacturing contexts. My research addresses technical, organizational, and educational aspects of the printing industry, with particular attention to digital workflows, quality control, industry structure, and the adoption of emerging technologies.

A significant part of my work examines the application and adoption of artificial intelligence within printing and manufacturing environments, focusing on reported use cases, benefits, challenges, and readiness conditions documented in the literature. I also study digital prepress workflows, PDF standards, and print quality assurance practices, with an emphasis on process reliability and operational control. Additional research interests include visual print quality, material-based print outcomes, and the analysis of industry conditions, particularly within the Malaysian context.

My teaching and academic activities are closely aligned with these research areas and include supervision, curriculum development, and contributions to printing-related education and skill development. Where appropriate, I engage with industry and educational partners through documented collaborative and professional activities.
